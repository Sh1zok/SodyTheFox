# SodyTheFox, general information:
This is a [Figura](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura) avatar of a cute furry fox. Author - I([Sh1zok](https://github.com/Sh1zok)). This avatar was named Sody because the coloring of this fox looks like soda lol. This avatar began development on May 25th and was finalized to version 1.0 on June 18th. This avatar was made in just a month since I had already managed to get my hand in on my other avatar. This avatar combines quite a few of my developments, including libraries (for example, SAM and SOM) and various QOL systems.
